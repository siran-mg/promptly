# Testing Requirements

## View and Functionality Testing

All features in the project must be tested for both:
1. View/UI components
2. Functionality/Logic

### View Testing Requirements
- Test component rendering
- Test UI states (loading, error, success)
- Test responsive design
- Test accessibility
- Test user interactions

### Functionality Testing Requirements
- Test business logic
- Test data flow
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases
- Test integration with external services (e.g. Supabase)

### Example
The reset password page [src/app/[locale]/auth/reset-password/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/[locale]/auth/reset-password/page.tsx) should have tests for:
- Form rendering
- Password validation
- Error messages display
- Success state
- Integration with Supabase auth
