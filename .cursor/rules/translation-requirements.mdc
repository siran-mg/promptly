# Translation Requirements

## Multilingual Support Guidelines

All text content in the application must be available in both English (en) and French (fr).

### Translation Implementation Rules
1. No hardcoded text strings in components or pages
2. All text must use the translation system via `useTranslations` hook
3. Translation keys must be organized hierarchically
4. All new components must have corresponding translation entries

### Translation Files Structure
- Translations should be stored in locale files
- Each feature should have its own translation namespace
- Translation keys should follow the pattern: `feature.section.key`

### Example
The reset password page [src/app/[locale]/auth/reset-password/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/[locale]/auth/reset-password/page.tsx) demonstrates proper translation implementation:
- Uses `useTranslations` hook
- All UI text is translated
- Organized under "auth.resetPassword" namespace
- Includes error messages and form labels
